# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I explored various text classification techniques using multiple datasets, with a primary focus on a Twitter dataset. The task was approached in two main ways:

**Classical Machine Learning Models:**
I implemented and compared several traditional ML algorithms, including:

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**

- **Logistic Regression**

- **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

- **Random Forest**

- **LightGBM**


Neural Network Approach:
I also developed a neural network model to tackle the same classification task, aiming to compare its performance against the classical methods.
